# BioFL-GNN
BioFL-GNN is a comprehensive framework that integrates multimodal gene expression data and clinical data to identify biomarkers.
The methodology we used includes: 
(1) multimodal data integration and differential feature construction to address high dimensionality; 
(2) metaheuristic feature selection using six algorithms to determine the optimal gene subset; 
(3) patient knowledge graph construction using advanced similarity metrics (Bregman divergence, angular distance); and 
(4) classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) equipped with a Fast Local Convolution (FLC) layer to better capture local structural patterns.
